CIAY Day # 12

The dogmas of faith are a gift from God. They transform our lives and help us to live a virtuous life.
Dogmas give us boundaries. They help us to dive deeply into God's mysteries.
God has revealed himself through his Son Jesus Christ, so that we can know him, experience the depth of his love and submit to his will always.
