# CIAY 2023 Members
1. The countdown is ON - its less than 24 hours to CIAY 2023. Yeah!! So excited. :)

2. In order to prepare for this journey - please watch the below videos and print out the reading plan if you like to, it helps to track progress.

3. Fr Mike Schmitz is not part of the group and will not be joining as well, we only share the content from his programs.

  I am Michael Eltham, the moderator of the group - I'm not Fr Mike - even though we have the same name.
  Please contact me directly for any suggestions or questions.
